Q)How can you move or copy Jenkins from one server to another server
A) using the thinbackup plugin
first you will have to install this plugin in both your server
->Install ThinBackup on both the source and the target Jenkins servers
->Configure Backup Directory on both (in Manage Jenkins → ThinBackup → Settings)
->On Sourse Jenkins go to ThinBackup → Backup Now
->Copy from Jenkins Source Backup directory to Jenkins Target Backup Directory
On Target Jenkins go to ThinBackup → Restore, and then restart Jenkins service.
If some Plugins or Jobs are missing, copy the backup content directly to the target JENKINS_HOME.
If you had user authentication on the source Jenkins, and now locked out on the target Jenkins, 
then edit Jenkins config.xml, set <useSecurity> to false, and restart Jenkins.

Q)Explain about Jenkins security mechanism
A)Jenkins has a security mechanism in place so that the administrator of Jenkins can control 
who gets access to what part of Jenkins.
